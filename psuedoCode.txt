Order Items Psuedo Code

/*************
Step 1: Set Up
*************/

Create Order Item Class:
- Properties:
	- Picture??
	- Item Name
	- Quantity
	- Base Price
	- Total Price = Base Price * Quantity

- Methods:
	- To String
	- To Form??

Create Order Item Array:
- Holds our Order Item objects

/*****************
Step 2: Get Orders
*****************/

When User selects an item:
- Construct Order Item Object via form values
- Add Object to Array

When User selects Checkout:
- Print To String and ask for confirmation
- If confirmed, then move to Step 3
- If denied, then clear Array and repeat Step 2

- Thought: Do we want the ability to edit as opposed to starting from scratch??


/***************
Step 3: Checkout
***************/

Get Contact Data:
- Get address, payment info, delivery/pickup, etc from User

Get Receipt:
- Loop through Order Items Array

- Once the whole array is complete, add Taxes, Tips, and Misc Charges to Receipt Total
- Add Receipt Total to the end of the Receipt
